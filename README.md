# Enterprise-Network-Simulation-Project-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

This project simulates a multi-floor enterprise environment with VLAN segmentation, DHCP, DNS, and inter-VLAN routing.

Key Features:
• Multiple VLANs for different departments (Management, HR, Finance, ICT, etc.)
• DHCP server for automatic IP assignment
• DNS server for name resolution across the network
• Inter-VLAN routing through multilayer switches and routers
• Redundant links between routers for fault tolerance
• Access points, printers, and PCs per department
• Full connectivity tested using ICMP and DNS lookups

Tools & Technologies:
